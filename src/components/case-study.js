      Lorem ipsum about lorem ipsum â˜º
    </h3>
    <p className="case-study__text">
      Lorem ipsum is a pseudo-Latin text used in web design, typography, layout,
      and printing in place of English to emphasise design elements over
      content. It's also called placeholder (or filler) text. It's a convenient
      tool for mock-ups. It helps to outline the visual elements of a document
      or presentation, eg typography, font, or layout. Lorem ipsum is mostly a
      part of a Latin text by the classical author and philosopher Cicero.

      I don't know how I would feel if in the future my speech was used to
      represent a bunch of nonsense
    </h3>
    Its words and letters have been changed by addition or removal, so to
    deliberately render its content nonsensical; it's not genuine, correct, or
    comprehensible Latin anymore. While lorem ipsum's still resembles classical
    Latin, it actually has no meaning whatsoever. As Cicero's text doesn't
    contain the letters K, W, or Z, alien to latin, these, and others are often
    inserted randomly to mimic the typographic appearence of European languages,
    as are digraphs not to be found in the original.
